# 1to1circumbinary

This code was used to calculate the data used in the paper "Stability of coorbital planets around binaries" whose publication in currently pending.
It is uploaded here in order to enable anyone to look into how our results were found and may reproduce them.

This code grew over time, which is why some choices in the implementation may seem suboptimal.
However, since it was never meant for public use, we elected not to "clean up" the implementation as the point of this publication is to provide insight on the exact code we used in the paper.

In case of any questions related to the code, contact stefan.adelbert@outlook.com
